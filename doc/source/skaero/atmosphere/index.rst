Atmosphere module
=================

The atmosphere modeled by **scikit-aero** follows the U.S. Committee on
Extension to the Standard Atmosphere (COESA), also known as U.S Standard
Atmosphere 1976.

This atmosphere rotates with the Earth. The air is assumed to follow all the
laws for perfect gas and the hydrostatics equations. Therefore a realation
between temperature, pressure and density can be stablished with geopotential.
