About skaero
============

The package collects different algorithms that solve for classical aeronautical
or aerospace problems such us finding the isentropic relations for a given Mach
number, atmospheric properties for a given altitude and many others.

History

.. _Juan Luis Cano: https://github.com/Juanlu001
.. _Guilles Aouizerate: https://github.com/Gillu13
.. _Javier J. Gutiérrez: https://github.com/javierj
.. _Jorge Martínez: https://github.com/jorgepiloto

The project was started by `Juan Luis Cano`_. With the contribution of
`Guilles Aouizerate`_ and `Javier J. Gutiérrez`_ more implementations to the
package were done such us tests implementation and extension of the COESA model
up to 86km.

After some time, the project was no longer mantained till `Jorge Martínez`_
started working again on `skaero`: a Python package for aeronautical and
aerospace computations.

.. _Matlab Aerospace Toolbox: www.mathworks.com/help/aerotbx/index.html
.. _PDAS: http://www.pdas.com/index.html

Many different softwares that enable the user to make similar computations are
listed down:

- `AeroCalc`_
- `Matlab Aerospace Toolbox`_
- `PDAS`_

In future versions
------------------

We are still working in this software and therefore issues and pull requests are
welcome. Some ideas for the moment are:

- Improve project documentation
- Implement GOST russian atmosphere
- Include more examples on how to use the package

Please, take a look to the official repository in GitHub if you want to make
a contribution to the project.
